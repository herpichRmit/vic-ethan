        <h1>Hi Vic!</h1>
        <p>I'm glad your here</p>
        <p>Welcome to our new website. Together we can use this as a platform to work together, to demo each other projects or to communicate with each via HTML (best method of communication)</p>
        <p>Lets get started...</p>
        <p>For January I decided to build your belated Chirstmas present. It's a review of what we've been upto since we started dating. Hope you enjoy!</p>
